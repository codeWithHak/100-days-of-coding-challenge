Q66 - Logical AND Verification: Create a function that checks two boolean (true or false) values. It should only say true if both are true, using the && operator. For instance, checkBothTrue(true, false) should be false.

**Q67** - Arithmetic with Mixed Types: Write a function that takes two parameters: a number and a string that represents a number (e.g., "5"). Return their sum as a number.

**Q68** - Multiplying Decimals: Create a function that accepts two decimal numbers and returns their product. Round the result to two decimal places.

**Q69** - Dividing and Finding the Remainder: Write a function that divides two numbers and returns both the quotient and the remainder. Use an object to return both values.
