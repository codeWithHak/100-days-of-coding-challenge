// Q21 - Then think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.

let myInfo: {name:string,age:number}={
    name:"Huzair",
    age:18
}
console.log(`Name: ${myInfo.name}, Age: ${myInfo.age}`);

export{} // used export just to remove red squiggly line
