Question 106: Determine if a given year is a leap year using comparison operators.

Explain & TIP: A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it's also divisible by 400. This rule helps align our calendar years with the Earth's orbital period.


Question 107: Write a condition using logical operators that checks if a number is divisible by both 2 and 3.

Explain & TIP: Checking for divisibility involves using the modulo operator (%) to see if there's any remainder. A number divisible by both 2 and 3 without a remainder is also divisible by 6.


Question 108: Compare two strings to check if they are identical, ignoring case sensitivity.

Explain & TIP: To compare strings without considering their case (uppercase/lowercase), you can convert both strings to the same case before comparing.


Question 109: Write an if statement that logs "Good Morning" if the current time is before 12 PM.

Explain & TIP: You can get the current hour using the Date object and its getHours() method. Remember, hours are in 24-hour format, so 12 PM is 12.


Question 110: Create a function that assigns a grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on a student's score.

Explain & TIP: A common grading system assigns letter grades based on score ranges. You can use an if-else-if chain to determine the grade.


Question 111: Use an if-else-if chain to categorize a person's age group (child, teenager, adult).

Explain & TIP: Age groups can typically be categorized by specific ranges. For instance, you might consider anyone under 13 a child, between 13 and 19 a teenager, and 20 or older an adult.
