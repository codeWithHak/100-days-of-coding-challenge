Question 70: Understanding let in Loops: Write a function that uses a loop with the let keyword to print numbers from 1 to 5. Explain how the let keyword affects the visibility of the loop variable.

Question 71: Compare let and const: Create two examples where let allows reassignment but const does not. Try to reassign a const-declared variable and catch the error.

Question 72: Block Scope with let and const: Demonstrate block scope by creating a code block with {} that uses both let and const. Show how variables declared inside the block are not accessible outside of it.

Question 73: Assigning and Updating Variables: Create a function where you declare a variable using let and assign an initial value. Then, update its value within the same function and log both the initial and updated values.

Question 74: Swapping Variables: Demonstrate how to swap the values of two variables. Start with variables `a = 5` and `b = 10`, then swap their values so that `a` becomes `10` and `b` becomes `5`.

Question 75: Compound Assignment Operators: Use compound assignment operators to simplify arithmetic operations. Start with `x = 4` and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on `x` using compound operators.
