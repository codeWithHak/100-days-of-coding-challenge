Q11 - Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a array called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

Q12 - Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

Q13 - Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

Q14 - Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

Q15 - Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite:

Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.

Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.

Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.
