Explain & TIP: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It's easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. Converting a JavaScript object into a JSON string can be done using JSON.stringify().


Question 134: Take a JSON string and parse it into a JavaScript object.

Explain & TIP: JSON.parse() is used to convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object. This is particularly useful when dealing with data received as JSON from a web server or API


Question 135: Explain how you can format a JSON string with proper indentation for readability.
